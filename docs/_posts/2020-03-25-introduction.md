## Introduction 

This project is the begining of the construction of an api for eyes of network. This project had for purpose to offer in the future a better way to manage our products.

## Presentation: What is EONAPI?
Eyes Of Network includes a web-based "RESTful" API (Application Programming Interface) called EONAPI that enables external programs to access information from the monitoring database and to manipulate objects inside the databases of EON suite.

The EON HTTP API offers the following functionality:
* Functions for manipulating objects (e.g. edit, add, delete)
